Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

Job 7:

Job 9:

        - Regex to filter down to main chromosomes

MissingOutputException in rule pwmscan_main_compile_pwmscan in file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctubbs750/pwm-scan/main/workflow/rules/main.smk, line 30:
Job 7  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../resources/software/PWMScan/matrix_prob
../resources/software/PWMScan/matrix_scan
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
