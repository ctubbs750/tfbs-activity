Job 1: 
        Returns list of all TFs and their JASPAR profiles from UniBind
        
Reason: Missing output files: resources/data/unibind/targets.txt

[Sun Dec 24 10:50:57 2023]
Error in rule unibind_make_targets:
    jobid: 1
    input: resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked_flat
    output: resources/data/unibind/targets.txt
    log: workflow/logs/make_targets.stdout, workflow/logs/make_targets.stderr (check log file(s) for error details)
    shell:
        
        ls resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked_flat | cut -d"." -f3 -f4-5 | sort -u > resources/data/unibind/targets.txt
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job unibind_make_targets since they might be corrupted:
resources/data/unibind/targets.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
