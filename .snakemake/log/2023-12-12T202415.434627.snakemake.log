MissingOutputException in rule unibind_unpack_unibind in file /panfs/accrepfs.vampire/data/ruderferlab/projects/biovu/cnv/cre/CTCF-Variant-Annotation/snakemake/workflows/common/tfbs-activity/workflow/rules/unibind.smk, line 48:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
resources/data/unibind/damo_hg39_all_TFBS
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
