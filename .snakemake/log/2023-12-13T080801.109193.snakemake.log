Job 2: 
        - Flattens unpacked tarbell. Not great - for the moment just check for creation of first in OP.
        Also removes all the empty dirs.
        
Reason: Missing output files: resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked
DAG of jobs will be updated after completion.

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule unibind_flatten_dir in file /panfs/accrepfs.vampire/data/ruderferlab/projects/biovu/cnv/cre/CTCF-Variant-Annotation/snakemake/workflows/common/tfbs-activity/workflow/rules/unibind.smk, line 51:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
