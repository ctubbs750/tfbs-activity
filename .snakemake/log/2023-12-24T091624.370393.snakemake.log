Job 1:

        Also removes all the empty dirs.
        
Reason: Missing output files: resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked_flat; Input files updated by another job: resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked

Removing output files of failed job unibind_flatten_dir since they might be corrupted:
resources/data/unibind/damo_hg38_all_TFBS_unpacked_flat
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
