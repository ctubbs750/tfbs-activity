Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 4
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Job 1: 
        Makes final target list.
        
Reason: Input files updated by another job: resources/data/unibind/combine_targets.txt; Set of input files has changed since last execution; Code has changed since last execution

Error in rule unibind_format_targets:
    jobid: 1
    input: resources/data/unibind/combine_targets.txt
    output: resources/data/unibind/targets.txt
    log: workflow/logs/format_targets.stdout, workflow/logs/format_targets.stderr (check log file(s) for error details)
    shell:
        
        cut -d"." --output-delimiter=$'	' |
        vawk '{print $1, $2"."$3, $4}' > resources/data/unibind/targets.txt
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job unibind_format_targets since they might be corrupted:
resources/data/unibind/targets.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
