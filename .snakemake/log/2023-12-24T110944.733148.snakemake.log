Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

Job 6: 
        Returns list of all matrix lengths from JASPAR API
        
Reason: Forced execution

Removing output files of failed job unibind_fetch_lengths since they might be corrupted:
resources/data/unibind/target_lengths.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
